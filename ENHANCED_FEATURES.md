# Enhanced Tree Data Provider Fe#### Creating Collections

- Click the folder button (üìÅ) in the tree view header to create a new collection
- Alternatively, click the dropdown arrow next to the plus button and select "New Collection"
- Enter a name for your collection
- Collections appear as expandable folders in the tree with "üìÅ" prefix

This document describes the new enhanced features added to the Reswob HTTP Client tree data provider.

## New Features

### 1. **Improved User Experience** ‚ú®

The tree data provider has been enhanced to provide a cleaner and more intuitive interface:

- **Toolbar Actions**: Added dedicated buttons at the top of the tree view - a plus button for creating new requests and a folder button for creating collections
- **Dropdown Menu**: A dropdown button with a down caret provides quick access to both "New Request" and "New Collection" options
- **Clean Tree View**: Removed the inline "Create New Request" item from within the tree for a cleaner interface
- **Always Visible Vim Toggle**: The Vim mode toggle is now always visible in the webview interface
- **Better Visual Feedback**: All items now include emoji indicators and improved tooltips

### 2. **Method Badges** üéØ

Each HTTP request now displays a colored emoji badge indicating the request method:

- üü¢ **GET** - Green circle
- üü° **POST** - Yellow circle
- üü† **PUT** - Orange circle
- üî¥ **DELETE** - Red circle
- üü£ **PATCH** - Purple circle
- üîµ **HEAD** - Blue circle
- ‚ö™ **OPTIONS** - White circle
- ‚ö´ **UNKNOWN** - Black circle (for any other methods)

### 3. **Collections Support** üìÅ

Organize your HTTP requests into collections for better management:

#### Creating Collections

- Click the new folder icon (ÔøΩ) in the tree view header to create a new collection
- When no collections exist, click on the "üìÅ Create your first collection..." hint
- Enter a name for your collection
- Collections appear as expandable folders in the tree with "üìÅ" prefix

#### Managing Requests in Collections

- **Add to Collection**: Right-click on any request ‚Üí "Add to Collection"
- **Remove from Collection**: Right-click on a request in a collection ‚Üí "Remove from Collection"
- **Drag & Drop**: Drag requests between collections or to the root level
- **Visual Guidance**: Collections now display helpful tooltips "Drag requests here to organize"

### 4. **Drag and Drop Support** üîÑ

Easily reorganize your requests with improved visual feedback:

- Drag requests from the root level into collections
- Drag requests between different collections
- Drag requests out of collections back to the root level
- Enhanced tooltips guide users on drag and drop functionality
- Visual feedback during drag operations

### 5. **Enhanced Context Menu** üìã

Right-click on tree items for more options:

#### For Requests:

- **Load Request** - Open the request in the HTTP client
- **Delete Request** - Remove the request permanently
- **Add to Collection** - Move request to a collection
- **Remove from Collection** - Move request out of collection

#### For Collections:

- **Delete Collection** - Remove the collection (requests remain in root)

### 6. **Tree Data Provider Delete Functionality** üóëÔ∏è

Delete functionality has been moved from the webview to the tree data provider:

- Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to requests or collections
- Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental deletions
- Requests deleted from collections are moved to root, not permanently deleted
- Collections can be deleted while preserving their requests

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface TreeItem {
  type: 'collection' | 'request';
  id: string;
  name: string;
  method?: string;
  collection?: string;
}

interface RequestCollection {
  version: string;
  requests: HttpRequest[];
  collections: CollectionFolder[];
}

interface CollectionFolder {
  name: string;
  requests: string[];
  color?: string;
}

interface HttpRequest {
  name: string;
  method: string;
  url: string;
  headers: Record<string, string>;
  body?: string;
  timestamp: string;
  collection?: string;
}
```

### Commands Added

- `reswob-http-client.deleteRequest` - Delete a request from tree view
- `reswob-http-client.deleteCollection` - Delete a collection
- `reswob-http-client.createCollection` - Create a new collection
- `reswob-http-client.addToCollection` - Add request to collection
- `reswob-http-client.removeFromCollection` - Remove request from collection

### Drag and Drop

The tree view now implements `TreeDragAndDropController` interface:

- Supports dragging requests between different container types
- Provides visual feedback during drag operations
- Handles drop validation and data transfer

## Usage Examples

### Basic Workflow

1. Create requests using the HTTP client webview
2. Organize related requests into collections using the tree view
3. Use drag and drop to reorganize requests
4. Delete requests or collections directly from the tree view
5. Method badges help identify request types at a glance

### Team Collaboration

- Collections help organize API endpoints by feature or service
- Method badges provide quick visual identification
- Drag and drop makes reorganization effortless
- Export/import functionality works with collections

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing request files are automatically upgraded to support collections
- All existing requests appear in the root level initially
- No data loss when upgrading from previous versions
- Webview delete functionality is preserved for user preference

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:

- Tree item creation for all types (requests, collections, new-request)
- Method badge generation for all HTTP methods
- Tree structure with collections and uncategorized requests
- Event handling and refresh functionality
- Edge cases and error conditions
